<h1>Savanna-la-Mar, Westmoreland</h1>

<p>Colonists named this parish Westmoreland in 1703, after the English took over the island from Spanish rule in 1665; it is likely that it received its name as it was the most westerly point of the island. Savanna-la-Mar, the capital, was developed as a port from which sugar was exported and dates back to around 1730. The Spanish name Savanna-la-mar means “plain by the sea” and refers to its environment. One of the first Spanish settlements was also built at present-day Bluefields in this parish. During the serious times of Covid-19, Sandals (volunteer:Rochelle Forbes-Reid) stood up and delivered tokens to some shut-ins (Lavern Brooks). </p>
